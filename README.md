# mouse-recorder

tinytask is gone so made my own in autoit

Use however you want

Script runs like any script via autoit v3+ https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/

When recording stops, the recording is automatically stored in same folder script runs from.

Playback loops, meant for repeatitive tasks with mouse

I intended to use it with toggle shortcut keys PGDN (for recording) and PAUSE (for playback)
